---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current Experience
- Users select a city (e.g., Raipur) and browse available movies.
- If a searched movie is not playing in that city, the app shows **“No shows available”**.
- Users typically drop off at this stage.

### User Problem
- Users are willing to travel to nearby cities to watch certain movies.
- The app currently does not allow users to:
  - Discover nearby cities where the movie is playing.
  - Compare distance, travel time, and show timings.
  - Seamlessly book tickets for outstation cinemas.

### Business Opportunity
- Redirect unmet demand to nearby cities where the movie is available.
- Increase total ticket sales for regional and niche language films.
- Improve user satisfaction, retention, and perceived usefulness of the app.

---

## 2. Target User Persona

- **Age:** 22–35
- **Location:** Tier-2 / Tier-3 cities (e.g., Raipur)
- **Behavior:** Frequent movie-goer, fan of regional cinema (Malayalam, Tamil, Korean, Anime)
- **Motivation:** Willing to travel for a special theatrical release
- **Goal:** Quickly find where the movie is playing and book tickets with minimal effort

---

## 3. Feature Concept: “Find Nearest Show”

A contextual discovery and booking option that appears whenever a movie is not available in the user’s selected city.

---

## 4. Entry Points

### A. Movie Detail Page
When no shows are available in the current city:
- Message: **“No shows in Raipur”**
- Primary CTA button: **“Find nearest show”**

### B. Search Results Page
When a searched movie is unavailable:
- Inline message:  
  **“Not available in Raipur. Want to travel?”**

---

## 5. User Flow

### Step 1: Location Permission / Selection
Prompt the user to determine their starting location.

Options:

Fallback:
- If location permission is denied, default to manual city selection.

---

### Step 2: Nearest Shows List
Display a list of nearby cities and cinemas where the movie is playing.

Sorting logic:
1. Distance from user
2. Earliest available showtime

Each card displays:
- City name
- Cinema name(s)
- Distance (km)
- Estimated travel time (e.g., “~2.5 hrs by road”)
- Next 3 available showtimes

Filters:
- Language (Original / Dubbed)

---

### Step 3: Show & Seat Selection

- City and cinema
- Showtime and seats
- Map icon / direction placeholder
- Informational note:  
  **“You’re travelling from Raipur. Plan your travel accordingly.”**

---

## 6. Edge Cases

### No Nearby Shows

- Message:  
  **“No nearby shows found within 400 km.”**
- Suggested actions:
  - Expand search radius
  - Check BookMyShow Stream
  - Set an alert for local release

### Multiple Language Versions
- Allow filtering by language (e.g., Malayalam, Hindi dubbed).

---

## 7. UI & UX Guidelines

- **Platform:** Mobile-first
- **Visual Style:** Consistent with BookMyShow
  - Red as primary accent
  - Card-based layouts
  - Clean typography
- **Microcopy Tone:** Friendly, supportive, travel-aware
